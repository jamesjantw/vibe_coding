## 1. Method Overview

### üß† BMAD-method
BMAD (Behavioral Multi-Agent Development) is a method centered on "multi-agent collaboration" for AI agile development.
It simulates the interactions between complete software teams (PO, PM, Architect, Dev, QA, UI/UX) and automates advancement through context and task division.
Emphasizes **agent-based decision-making, context engineering, repeatable agile cycles**.

**Latest Version Features**:
- **Modular Architecture**: Supports expansion pack system, applicable to any domain like game development, creative writing
- **Dual Environment Support**: Optimized for Web UI (planning phase) and IDE (development phase)
- **Intelligent Configuration System**: core-config.yaml enables project structure flexibility
- **Quality Assurance Architecture**: Test Architect (Quinn) provides professional testing strategies and quality gate controls

**Applicable Scenarios**
- Complex cross-domain projects (ERP, Portal, AI Agent)
- Teams with clear division of labor requiring high traceability
- Development environments needing AI participation in strategic decisions
- Any domain projects: software development, game development, creative writing, business strategy, etc.
- New projects (Greenfield) and existing project enhancements (Brownfield)

### ‚öôÔ∏è Openspec
OpenSpec is a development framework centered on "specification-driven development" ideology.
It incorporates "proposal ‚Üí review ‚Üí implementation ‚Üí archiving" into automated cycles to ensure consistency between requirements, design, and code.
Emphasizes **auditable, traceable, reproducible** collaboration modes.

**Applicable Scenarios**
- SaaS / API platform development and operations
- Highly compliant and review-demanding scenarios (enterprise projects)
- Open source communities or multi-person collaborative projects

#### Step 3: Start Planning (Web UI or IDE Phase)

**Option A: Web UI Planning (Recommended for Beginners, Cost-Effective)**
In Gemini or other Web UI:

**Initial Prompt Examples**:
```
I want to create a [project type, e.g.: task management application].

Project goal: [Brief description of your idea]
Main features: [List 3-5 core features]
Target users: [Describe target user group]
Tech preferences: [Mention preferred tech stack if any]

Please help me plan this project using BMAD-method team.
```

**Specific Planning Prompts**:
```
@pm I need to create a PRD for a task management application. This application should allow users to create, edit, and track tasks, support team collaboration, and have basic reporting functionality. Guide me through the PRD creation process.
```

```
@architect Based on this PRD, design a scalable system architecture. Considering users may grow to 10,000 people and need to support mobile applications.
```

**Option B: IDE Direct Planning (For Experienced Developers)**
In Kilo Code or other BMAD-supporting IDE:

**Install and Launch**:
```bash
# Install BMAD to project
npx bmad-method install

# Launch planning mode
@pm create-doc prd
```

**IDE Planning Prompt Examples**:
```
@pm I want to create a task management application. Help me create a complete PRD including user stories, functional requirements, and acceptance criteria.

Project background: A tool supporting team collaboration for task management
Main features:
- Task creation, editing, deletion
- Team member assignment
- Progress tracking and reporting
- Notification system

Guide me step by step through PRD creation.
```

```
@architect Now that PRD is complete, design the technical architecture for this task management system.

Technical requirements:
- Frontend: React or Vue
- Backend: Node.js or Python
- Database: PostgreSQL or MongoDB
- Support 1000+ concurrent users
- Need RESTful API

Create complete architecture documentation.
```

**IDE Planning Advantages**:
- Work directly in development environment
- Documents automatically saved to project structure
- Immediate transition to development phase possible
- No need to copy documents between different environments

#### Step 4: Development Phase (IDE Phase)
After switching to your IDE:

**Story Development Prompts**:
```
@sm Create the next development story for user authentication functionality. Reference security requirements in PRD and authentication design in architecture document.
```

```
@dev Implement this user login function. Remember to include password validation, session management, and error handling. Reference security design in architecture document.
```

```
@qa Check this login function implementation, ensure it complies with security standards and has appropriate test coverage.
```

### üìã Openspec Quick Start Guide

### üîß Common Questions & Solutions

#### BMAD-method Common Questions
**Q: Where should I start for first use?**
A: Start in Web UI, use `/help` command to understand available functions, then say `/pm I want to create a [your project idea]`.

**Q: How to switch between different environments?**
A: After completing planning in Web UI, copy generated documents to project's `docs/` folder, then continue development in IDE.

#### Openspec Common Questions
**Q: How detailed should specifications be?**
A: Specifications should be detailed enough for developers to directly write code based on them, but not over-designed. Include input output formats, error handling, and edge cases.

**Q: How to handle specification changes?**
A: All specification changes must go through review process, create new versions, and record change reasons.
