## üìö Usage Tips

### Principles for Writing Effective Prompts

1. **Specific and Clear** - Clearly describe expected output
2. **Provide Context** - Include relevant background information
3. **Specify Format** - Indicate expected response format
4. **Set Limits** - Clearly state scope and constraints

### Mandatory Requirement Reminders

**‚ö†Ô∏è All Agents must remember:**

Every completion of a work session must immediately execute the following four items:

1. **üìñ File Update Preparation**
    - Use read_file to read latest content
    - Ensure understanding of complete current file state
    - Avoid updates based on outdated memory

2. **üìù Update Related Files**
    - Record processing procedures and completed items
    - Update task status and progress tracking

3. **üìã Update Change Log**
    - Record changes in project root CHANGELOG.md
    - Include date, author, change content, and impact scope

4. **üîÑ Update File Status**
    - Update status of all related files in docs/ directory
    - Mark completed items, in-progress items, pending items
    - Update last modification time and personnel information

### Best Practices

- **Progressive Questioning** - Start high-level, gradually refine
- **Reference Existing Documents** - Utilize existing project documents
- **Include Examples** - Provide examples of expected output
- **Specify Priorities** - Clearly state what aspects are most important
- **Follow Coding Standards** - @dev must read coding-standards.md first
- **Safe File Updates** - Always read latest content before updates
- **Complete Recording** - Update file status at end of every phase

### Common Patterns

- **Task Decomposition**: Break large tasks into small steps
- **Conditional Branching**: Provide different handling for different scenarios
- **Quality Checks**: Include verification and testing requirements
- **File Generation**: Specify output file formats and content
- **Status Tracking**: Record progress and problems for each step
